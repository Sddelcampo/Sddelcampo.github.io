  This is the index.html page for homework 4, which puts into practice callbacks through a rock,
  paper, scissors game where the user will select either rock, paper, or scissors and the computer
  (which will serve as the opponent) will select randomly rock, paper, or scissors and based on
  the results will show wheter the user or computer has won, draw, or lost.

            <h2>Dine? on Campus?</h2>
            You heard that right, at UNCG there is a lot of history dating back from the 1800s! That
            also includes foods and meals. Sure UNCG offers the Cafeteria, but if you are on here,
            you are most likely already tired or bored of the food and are needing some pizazz.
            Don't live on campus? That's no problem because you are still able to get the best of
            foods here at the G. The place being Tate street where foods from all over the world
            join in. All of that being a walk away from the UNCG Petty Building!
